# Welcome to Dumb it Down!

Here at Dumb it Down, we attempt to takle the notion of boring research papers to an intresting one. We take a research paper that has a significant imact on the progress of science and break it into simpler segements which are fun to read and easy-to-understand, with a pinch of humor baked into it. In short, we simplify groundbreaking research papers.
