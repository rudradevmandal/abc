abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}For 30 years, this classic text has been the acknowledged standard in classical mechanics courses. Classical Mechanics enables students to make connections between classical and modern physics an indispensable part of a physicist s education. The authors have updated the topics, applications, and notations to reflect today s physics curriculum. They introduce students to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics. New numerical exercises help students develop skills in the use of computer techniques to solve problems in physics. Mathematical techniques are presented in detail so that the text remains fully accessible to students who have not had an intermediate course in classical mechanics.   {\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}The classical approach of this leading text book has been revised and updated A section on the Euler and Lagrange exact solutions to the three-body problem A section on the damped driven oscillator as an example of the workings of the Josephson junction Chapter on canonical perturbation theory has been streamlined and the mathematics has been simplified Approximately 45 new problems, mostly in Chapters 1 8 and 11. Problems sets are now divided into Derivations and Exercises Solutions for 19 select problems have been provided in Appendix C   {\textless}/p{\textgreater}

@article{Podolsky1928,
abstract = {Dirac showed that, if in the Hamiltonian H momenta $\eta$r conjugate to the co-ordinates $\xi$r are replaced by (h/2$\pi$i)∂/∂$\xi$r, the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation appropriate to the coordinate system $\xi$r is (H-E)$\psi$$\xi$=0. Applied to coordinate systems other than cartesian this usually leads to incorrect results. The difficulty is here traced partially to the way in which $\psi$$\xi$ is normalized and partly to the choice of H. In H expressions such as qpq-1p and p2 are not equivalent, and the simplified form is generally incorrect. A formula satisfying all the requirements of quantum mechanics for a Hamiltonian of a conservative system, in an arbitrary coordinate system, is therefore developed H=1/2$\mu$$\Sigma$r=1r=n$\Sigma$s=1s=ng-1/4prg1/2grspsg-1/4+U This formula is applied to a case of plane polar coordinates and leads to correct results.},
